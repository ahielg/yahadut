package hebDate.suntimes;

/**
 * %%Ignore-License
 * Java class for representing a time as a simple triple of numbers (hours,
 * minutes, seconds). This class is used by the SunTimes class to return sunrise
 * and sunset times, where the meanings of the hours and minutes are well defined.
 * This class obviates the need to use the JDK Date and Calendar classes, which do
 * all sorts of locale-specific corrections.
 * <p/>
 * This class can be initialized from a pair of values, or a single value which is
 * taken to mean a number of hours with a fraction. In the latter case it will
 * normalize it to the range 0:00:00 to 23:59:59.
 * <p/>
